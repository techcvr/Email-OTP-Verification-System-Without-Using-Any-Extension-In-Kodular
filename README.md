# Email-OTP-Verification-System-Without-Using-Any-Extension-In-Kodular

This is a basic OTP verification system using email. You will see OTP in the OTP status label , this is for test purpose, just to show you, you can change the blocks later. This is just an example to show that otp is received from server. You have to write your own method to use this otp system. For example storing the otp in a global variable and then match the user’s otp with global variable.

I have checked it and it seems to be working fine for me, i have tried it with the live test and it works ok
